                    Initially entering university to pursue a degree in accounting, after completing a number of
                    internships I realized I'd rather help someone spend their tax refund than to file for it. Upon
                    completion of my 3rd year, I took an opportunity to join Abruzzi Design Studio, a luxury home
                    remodeler, as an office administrator. Not long after starting, I was transitioned into a sales and
                    management role, where I received constant 1-on-1 mentoring in traditional floor sales, commercial
                    account management , new client generation, and soft-skills among many other aspects of the daily
                    function of a small business.

                    In the summer of 2019 I moved to Israel to explore a wealth of new opportunities. Spending time in
                    different parts of the country and attending two language schools. I now look to apply what I've
                    learned and to expand my knowledge in a goal and metric driven environment.
